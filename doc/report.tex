\section*{Executive summary}
This report summaries  the work done for the analysis of the effects of the bottom friction and vegetation in the wave dumping as part of the Wave-Hydrodynamic Modelling research project funded by the Department of Energy, Environment and Climate Action (DEECA). It focuses on the evaluation of ripples model to quantify the bottom friction in the Port Phillip Bay (PPB) using the state of the art wave physics and the newly ERA5 atmospheric forcing field with the wind field locally scaled up to optimise the wave model performance which was validated against the operational wave buoy network recently deployed within the Bay. The regional wave model exhibits a good performance for all the locations, however, some modifications have to be made in order to include more realistic scenarios in PPB. The inclusion of the vegetation was also tested under the Coupled Ocean-Atmosphere-Wave-Sediment Transport Modeling System (COAWST) but further details have to be defined before moving from the verified vegetation test case to an initial idealised case for PPB. The use of better input information will lead to a most physical-reliable wave propagation in the bay.\\


% The Port Phillip Bay (PPB) is arguably one of the most important environmental, social and economic asset in Victoria. In this study, the efforts to improve hydrodynamic climate of PPB is shown with the aid of a coupled high-resolution wave-current numerical modelling system (SCHISM-WWM) using advanced wave physics, the latest ERA5 atmospheric products as forcing conditions and a real-time observational buoy network recently deployed in PPB. The validation results indicate a good agreement between the model and the buoy measurements, even for the most extreme wave event in PPB, where the observed significant wave height $H_s$ exceeded 3.5 m at Mt Eliza. Further, long-term simulations under different sea level scenarios were conducted to hindcast sea state conditions for 32-years period (1990-2021) based on the newly validated modelling system. This data has been used to carried out extreme value analysis (EVA) to estimate 500-,100-,50-, and 20-year return levels of variables such as $H_s$, elevation and current speed for different locations within PPB according to the Victoria’s Resilient Coast guidelines.\\

\section{Introduction}

A broadly-used regional scale wave model is employed in Port Phillip Bay (PPB) to analyse the wave damping due to bottom dissipation and vegetation. This is an vital step to quantify the effect of the bottom conditions and habitat types in PPB and finally to represent enough accurately the wave climate across the bay. The University of Melbourne (UoM) has previously developed a coupled wave-hydrodynamic model (SCHISM-WWMIII) of PPB, through Dr. Huy Tran as a part of his PhD research, supervised by Prof. Alex Babanin, in collaboration with the Victorian Coastal Monitoring Program. Despite these advances, bottom friction physics (e.g. generation of ripples and its drag mechanism) and the interaction wave-current under vegetation cases are not completely implemented in SCHISM-WWMIII yet, which leads to the use of the Simulation WAves Nearshore (SWAN) model and its coupling with the Regional Ocean Modelling System (ROMS). Since Dec 2020, a network of wave buoys were deployed across the Bay as part of the Victorian Coastal Monitoring Program. It is now possible to produce an updated PPB wave model, utilising the wave buoy observations. The proposed project will take advance of the emerged numerical modelling and the newly available in-situ observation to:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Evaluate a more realistic bottom friction conditions in the wave damping for PPB.
    \item Assessing the impact of the vegetation in the wave propagation for some areas of the bay.
    \item Implementing a regional coupled wave-current simulation to include the effect of the vegetation in the ocean currents/sea level in PPB.
\end{itemize}

% Port Phillip Bay (PPB) is a dynamic system that covers approximately 1,934 km$^{2}$ and has 333 km of shoreline serving various human interests, including fishing, recreational activities, and ship navigation in Victoria (see Fig. \ref{fig:study_zone}). PPB has a tidal inlet system connected with a narrow entrance (a mere 3km wide) on the southern side where the bathymetry is very steep. Specifically, there is a deep and narrow canyon $>$ 90m deep and 150m wide, curved by relatively shallow regions where the water depth falls below 20m. Towards the inner bay, there is a main navigational channel system that dissects the shallow inlet region into two parts, featuring a sand island and many sand bars. Outside the inlet system, there is also a shallow C-curved region called the offshore bar. The entrance of PPB (Port Phillip Head [PPH] or simply the Heads) also exhibits energetic waves that propagate from the Southern Ocean and interact with strong inverse tidal currents all year around.

\section{Methodology}

\subsection{Numerical modelling framework}

All the models presented below were compiled in the general purpose High Performance Computing (HPC) system operated by Research Computing Services at The University of Melbourne (Spartan)

\subsubsection*{Wave model}

SWAN is a numerical model designed for simulating coastal wave dynamics that propagates the wave energy based on the wave action balance equation with sources and sinks using a spectral wave approach, allowing for detailed representation of wave energy across frequencies and directions. Notably, SWAN captures the nonlinear interaction between waves and wind, essential for accurately modelling coastal wave behaviour. It also accounts for shallow-water effects, including wave shoaling and refraction and it can be coupled with hydrodynamic models to study wave-current interactions, providing a comprehensive understanding of coastal processes. The model supports various boundary conditions and flexible grid systems, accommodating different coastal geometries and its reliability is backed by extensive validation against experiments and field measurements. Overall, SWAN is a valuable tool for coastal engineers, researchers, and decision-makers involved in coastal management, offering accurate simulations of complex coastal wave dynamics.\\

For the simulations in PPB, the depth-induced breaking was activated \parencite{Battjes1978}, the third-generation physics were also used. Different dissipation expressions by bottom friction were tested \parencite{Madsen_Poon_Graber_1988,Smith2011} and vegetation damping \parencite{Suzuki2011} was also included in some of the runs.

\subsubsection*{Ocean-wave model}

The current-wave interaction is intended to be studied using the modelling system COAWST \parencite{Warner2010}, an open-source model that combines many sophisticated systems that each provide relative earth-system components necessary to investigate the dynamics. Specifically, the COAWST Modeling System includes an ocean component—Regional Ocean Modeling System (ROMS); atmosphere component—Weather Research and Forecast Model (WRF), hydrology component- WRF\textunderscore Hydro; wave components—Simulating Waves Nearshore (SWAN), WAVEWATCHIII, and InWave; a sediment component—the USGS Community Sediment Models; and a sea ice model. This modelling system was used with the default values presented in each model and the atmospheric, sediment transport and infragavitatory wave models were not included.  

\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[scale=0.7]{plots/coawst_structure.PNG}
    \caption{Diagram with the model components of COAWST. The components used in this study are within the red box. The coupling variables are also depicted.}
    \label{fig:coawst_structure}
\end{figure}

The wave-flow vegetation module is integrated COAWST modeling system, incorporating both a flow model (ROMS) and a wave model (SWAN). The flow model has been adjusted to include posture-dependent three-dimensional drag from plants, in-canopy wave-induced streaming, and the generation of turbulent kinetic energy. The coupling framework was enhanced to exchange vegetation-related variables between the flow and wave models, thereby considering wave energy dissipation due to vegetation.

    \caption{Scheme of the vegetation module implemented in COAWST modelling system.}
    \label{fig:scheme_vegetation_module}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Model setup} \label{sec:model_setup}

\subsubsection{Bathymetric processing}

Bathymetry datasets were gathered from several sources at different resolutions ranging from 0.5 to 500 m. Within the southern area of PPB, including the entrance, bathymetry data were mainly measured via LADS surveys with a high resolution (up to 6 m). These bathymetric measurements were taken during summer 2007/2008 (before channel deepening) and summer 2009/2010 (after channel deepening). Along shipping channels, the bathymetry after dredging was measured by MBES with a 0.5 m resolution in a rectangular grid format. These high-resolution data used MGA94 (Zone 55) map projection. For other areas within PPB, bathymetry was taken from the Victorian coastal digital elevation model (VCDEM 2017) with a 500 m resolution. The bathymetry data was combined into a single set that covers the whole domain, and the information recorded in MGA94 projections within the southern region of PPB was converted into WGS84 projections to unify the coordinate system. The bathymetry can be visualized in the figure \ref{fig:bathy_PPB}.

\subsubsection{Computational mesh}

A curvilinear grid was used for all the simulation with 99 meshes in $\xi-$direction and 199 meshes in $\eta-$direction (see figure \ref{fig:grid_PPB}). This grid covers all the bay and initially its open boundary is extended further from the entrance of the bay into deep waters (approximately 70 m deep). This extension allows capturing waves from deep waters.

\end{figure}

\subsubsection {Model Forcing}

Coastal models are typically applied for a region in contact with external regions via the open boundary. Therefore, the open boundary conditions should be specified. The following sections describe the types of forcing required to run SWAN and ROMS.

\subsubsection*{Elevations/tidal forcing}

For coastal wave-current interaction modelling, the water level has to be specified across both time and space. In practice, at the very least, these water elevations (or tidal velocities) are then used to force the circulation model to capture the feedback between the waves and currents. To specify the tides across the domain, this study used the tidal constants computed from TPXO 8 Atlas data \parencite{Egbert2002} for the simulation period. The method used is harmonic analysis and the astronomic tides are constructed based on the registered harmonics.  

\subsubsection*{Atmospheric forcing}

In this study, the atmospheric forcing inputs for SCHISM/WWM were derived from the reanalysis ERA5 products \parencite{Hersbach2019}. It is the fifth generation ECMWF atmospheric reanalysis of the global climate, covering the period from January 1940 to present. ERA5 is produced by the Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S) at ECMWF. ERA5 provides hourly estimates of various atmospheric, land and oceanic climate variables. The data cover the Earth on a 30 km grid and resolve the atmosphere using 137 levels from the surface up to a height of 80 km. The wind forcing was downloaded from 0000 01-Oct-2021 to 2300 06-Nov-2021. 

\subsubsection*{Bottom conditions}

The grain diameter size is available in a cloud point for PPB. This data is formatted in phi scale as it can seen in the figure \ref{fig:diameter_phi} and it can be easily translated into a millimetre scale (fig. \ref{fig:diameter_mm}) using the equation:

\begin{equation}
    \phi = - \log_{2}\frac{D}{D_0}
\end{equation}

where $D_0$ is the standard diameter size equals to 1 mm and $D$ is the diameter in mm. This information has to be converted into mm in order to prepare the diameter size in a conventional measurement system that SWAN can read.

\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\begin{subfigure}{.5\textwidth}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[scale=0.45]{plots/maps/sediment_distribution_phi.png}
  \caption{Diameter grain size distribution in PPB [$\phi$ scale]}

\end{subfigure}%
\begin{subfigure}{.5\textwidth}

  \label{fig:diameter_mm}
\end{subfigure}
\caption{Conversion of the diameter grain size distribution in PPB from the $\phi$ to mm scale }
\label{fig:diameter_PPB}
\end{figure}

The highest values of diameter size are in the centre of the bay (close to 1 mm) while lowest diameter sizes are presented in some parts in the north/south. Because of the grain size data resolution neither does not match with the SWAN computation grid nor it is not regular, the information was spatially interpolated into a rectangular grid for PPB. A python script was made to build the regular grid from the cloud point in function of an initial point, longitude resolution $dx$ and latitude resolution $dy$.

\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[scale=0.45]{plots/maps/interpolated_D.png}
    \caption{Regular grid interpolated from grain size distribution in PPB. On the left panel the points inside the bay are dark cyan while the outer ones are red. The interpolated points inside PPB are shown in function of its diameter value on the right panel}
    \label{fig:interpolated_D}
\end{figure}

On the left panel in the figure \ref{fig:interpolated_D} an initial partitioning of the points based on whether they are inside on the bay or not. The points outside PPB are defined as \verb|NaN| values and the inner ones are spatially interpolated based on the neighbour locations as it shown in the right panel. The $dx$ and $dy$ are chosen for illustrative purposes, but a finer resolution (e.g. 0.01 degrees) can be selected as it be required.

\subsubsection*{Vegetation}

On top of the bottom grain size, the vegetation habitat types in PPB are also available. The sublittoral sand and sublittoral mud are the most dominant habitats in the area (see fig. \ref{fig:sg_PPB}) and other ecosystems like sublittoral seagrass beds are also prominent in Corio Bay, Swan Bay and Queenscliff.

\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[scale=0.4]{plots/maps/PPB_habitat_types_0.1_0.1.png}
    \caption{Habitat types and regular grid for specific gravity (SG) in PPB}
    \label{fig:sg_PPB}
\end{figure}

All the attributes for the habitat type data are assigned in polygons and they had to be converted into a regular grid as well. The specific gravity for those habitat types was then interpolated from the polygons to a regular grid due to it is used as an input variable in the \textcite{Smith2011} parametrization to compute the ripples in the wave dissipation by bottom friction. For the interpolation, different specific gravity values were assigned into the polygons accordingly with the habitat type (mud, sand, seaweed, sea grass, etc.). Each habitat type can even has its corresponding specific gravity range and therefore it is difficult determining a unique value of specific gravity, for example this variable for mud can range from 2.65 to 3.4. Additionally, there are some habitat types (i.e. related with vegetation) which have no clear information about their specific gravity like mangroves, sea grass, seabed, infralittoral rock, among others.\\

Clearly, describing the bottom friction and the specific gravity across the bay is more physically reliable/representative than just assigning a singular value for these variables for the entire area.

\subsection{Experiments}

In order to check the SWAN performance under different bottom friction parametrizations and to get the most physic reliable configuration, a set of experiments was purposed.

\begin{table}[h]
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|}
\hline
\rowcolor{orange}

\end{tabular}
\caption{Summary of the bottom friction configurations used in the experiments for PPB}
\end{table}

It has to be mentioned that \textcite{Madsen_Poon_Graber_1988} and \textcite{Smith2011} are dependent on different parameters. The key variable in \textcite{Madsen_Poon_Graber_1988} is an equivalent roughness length scale of the bottom, kn whom default value is 0.05 m. In \textcite{Smith2011} the two main variables are the specific gravity and the diameter grain size and their default values are 2.65 and 0.1 mm, respectively.

\subsection{Buoy measurements}

Victorian Coastal Monitoring Program (VCMP) deployed SOFAR Spotter buoys to measure the wave motions at sites along the perimeter and centre of PPB, as shown in Figure \ref{fig:buoy_measurements}. This real-time buoy network is part of the effort made by the Victorian government to understand how the deep water waves are transformed as they approach the shore and to develop a downscaling of models to associate wave climate with shoreline dynamics. The buoys record the rise and fall of the water surface approximately every half a second, use GPS positioning, transmit their data via satellite. The locations/labels of the buoys are: Werribee, Sandringham, Indented Head, Rosebud, Mt. Eliza, and Central PPB and they are recording wave variables such as SWH, peak direction, peak period, and mean period. These recorded variables were used to calibrate and validate the coupled modelling system to generate the long-term hindcast series in PPB.

\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
  \includegraphics[scale=0.3]{plots/maps/vicwaves_buoy_locations.png}
  \caption{Location of the buoy measurements in PPB. Extracted from \url{https://vicwaves.com.au/}.}
  \label{fig:buoy_measurements}
\end{figure}

The buoy data were pre-processed prior to be used during the calibration/validation stage, since irregular movements and moorings can generate physically unreasonable measurements in the real-time buoy network in PPB. The fast-changing periods of the measured variables along the time series are used to identify the unrealistic measurements.\\

Figure \ref{fig:pre_processing} shows the  measured $H_{s}$ time series  from each buoy in the raw format (blue line) and in the despiked format (or without noises) (orange line). Note that the Sandringham, Rosebud, Indented Head, and central PPB stations had at least one spike, but all of them were removed in the final $H_{s}$ time series.  All the buoys show a good agreement within the storm events. Mt. Eliza and Sandringham stations registered the highest $H_{s}$ values among all the datasets.

\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[scale=0.45]{plots/maps/buoy_despiked.pdf}
    \caption{Comparisons of the raw and processed (despiked) $H_{s}$ time series for each buoy location in PPB.}
    \label{fig:pre_processing}
\end{figure}

% A second simulation was carried out over the same period of time, with no scaling factor applied to the wind speed used in the model. This modification improved the estimation of the $H_{s}$ values in each buoy in comparison with the wind scaling factor simulation, but $H_{s}$ values for most buoys remained overestimated as well as the underestimation of the storm event recorded in Mt. Eliza in late October.

% Although overestimations of $H_{s}$ mean an underperformance of the modelling system, they do not represent a safety issue by comparison to the underestimations of storm events (e.g. Mt. Eliza buoy), therefore the main focus at this stage was on the enhancement of estimation of the events that were underestimated during the simulation period. In order to address this, a set of experiments were conducted. First, an experiment was performed to verify whether the waves generated by offshore were well represented by the model at Mt. Eliza. Secondly, experiments with changes of the main parameters of the dissipation, wind input, and bottom friction parametrizations used in the model to simulate the waves were developed, and finally, a local wind adjustment was done at grid points in the vicinity of the Mt. Eliza buoy.

% The best performance was obtained under the configuration of the localised wind scaling experiment. Figure \ref{fig:regional_wind_scaling} shows a better agreement between the high $H_{s}$ values registered by the Mt. Eliza buoy and estimated by the model.

% \begin{figure}[p]

%     \caption{$H_{s}$ time series for each buoy under the regional wind scaling experiment.}
%     \label{fig:regional_wind_scaling}
% \end{figure}

% As shown in Figure \ref{fig:qqplot}, RMSE is lower than 0.26 m at all the stations, and the negative mean bias per buoy demonstrates the overall model overestimation mentioned before. The best performance of the model was reported in the Sandringham station, while at the Rosebud station the highest overestimation of $H_{s}$ was recorded. This model configuration was then used for hindcast, including in the different sea level scenarios.

\section{Simulations results using different bottom friction parametrizations}

An initial simulation for one-month period (from 01/10/2021 to 01/11/2021) was conducted with the purpose of validating the wave model against buoy observations. A minimap is presented to guide the reader throughout the location of the stations in PPB and its correspondence with the $H_s$ series. 

\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[scale=0.35]{plots/maps/coastline_miniature.png}
    \caption{Minimap with symbols for each station in PPB}
    \label{fig:minimap}
\end{figure}

Firstly, the experiments \textbf{madsen} and \textbf{smith s2.65 d0.1} were compared to have a general perspective of the model performance for the simulation period.

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[scale=0.7]{plots/hs_series/madsen_vs_smith s2.65 d0.1_vert.png}
    \caption{$H_{s}$ time series for each buoy under madsen (pink line) and smith s2.65 d0.1 (cyan line) experiments.}
    \label{fig:hs_madsen_vs_smith_def}
\end{figure}

Both experiments represent correctly the $H_s$ variability along the simulation period, however, the maximum $H_s$ events are still underestimated by the model. Although the peaks are better estimated with \textbf{smith s2.65 d0.1} than \textbf{madsen}, there are differences between 0.5m and 0.8m between the largest simulated and measured $H_s$ per each station. Mt Eliza is the only station with $H_s$ values over 3m and it exhibits the highest $H_s$ event of 3.67 m, this event was not enough well captured by the model which represented 3.18 and 3.13 with \textbf{smith s.65 d0.1} and \textbf{madsen}, respectively.

    \label{fig:scatter_madsen_vs_smith_def}
\end{figure}

The differences between the experiments at the peaks do not have a strong influence in the skill metrics of the model as it presented in the scatter plots (see fig. \ref{fig:scatter_madsen_vs_smith_def}). The only change happens in the RMSE values for the Mt Eliza station where the \textbf{smith s2.65 d0.1} experiment has a value of 0.14 while \textbf{madsen} experiment has 0.15. Sandringham is the station with the largest positive bias which indicates an systematic $H_s$ underestimation. The possible presence of ripples in some areas in PPB would be best described by the \textcite{Smith2011} which would explain its slight better performance.\\

The following experiment is \textbf{smith s2.65 d0.78} which employs a more realistic diameter grain size of 0.78mm for the bay because is computed as the mean value for the entire area according to the dataset. This experiment is compared with \textbf{smith s2.65 d0.1} to establish a comparison about how the changes on the diameter grain size can affect the estimation of $H_s$ for the simulation period. The $H_s$ series are presented below.

\begin{figure}[H]

    \label{fig:hs_smith_def_vs_smith_0.78}
\end{figure}

The largest $H_s$ values for each station are better estimated by \textbf{smith s2.65 d0.1} than \textbf{smith s2.65 d0.78}, but the differences are not larger than 0.03 m. This behaviour is quite reasonable based on the fact that larger diameters trend to increase the Nikurade roughness, $k_s$ (see equation 11 in \textcite{Smith2011})

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[scale=0.7]{plots/scatter/smith s2.65 d0.1_vs_smith s2.65 d0.78_vert_sca.png}
    \caption{Comparison between modelled and observed $H_{s}$ values for each buoy for the experiments: smith s2.65 d0.1 (cyan dots) and smith s2.65 d0.78 (orange dots)}
    \label{fig:scatter_smith_def_vs_smith_0.78}
\end{figure}

The changes are not enough strong to modify the model skills when the experiments are compared throughout the scatter plots and 4 out of 6 stations (Sandringham, Werribee, Mt Eliza and Central PPB) show an overall underestimation. All the mean bias error (MBE), the correlation and the root mean squared error (RMSE) are identical for all the stations. Although the last experiment uses a most representative diameter grain size for the bay, the ideal scenario should be the inclusion of the spatial variability of the diameter across PPB because the dataset clearly shows that there is a range of variation from 0.3 to 1 mm (see fig. \ref{fig:diameter_PPB}). Another experiment is then tested using this new inclusion: \textbf{smith s2.65 dvar}.

\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[scale=0.7]{plots/hs_series/smith s2.65 d0.78_vs_smith s2.65 dvar_vert.png}
    \caption{$H_{s}$ time series for each buoy under smith s2.65 d0.78 (orange line) and smith s2.65 dvar (red line) experiments.}
    \label{fig:hs_smith_0.78_vs_smith_dvar}
\end{figure}

\textbf{smith s2.65 dvar} and \textbf{smith s2.65 d0.78} were compared to evaluate the effect of a most realistic diameter grain size information in the model. Despite the generation of the sediment diameter map, the largest $H_s$ values for each station barely increase between 0.01 and 0.03 m as it is depicted in the figure \ref{fig:hs_smith_0.78_vs_smith_dvar}. Stations like Sandringham still shows a systematic underestimation of the $H_s$ values and the maximum modelled $H_s$ value is still 0.5 m under the observation. 

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[scale=0.7]{plots/scatter/smith s2.65 d0.78_vs_smith s2.65 dvar_vert_sca.png}
    \caption{Comparison between modelled and observed $H_{s}$ values for each buoy for the experiments: smith s2.65 d0.78 (orange dots) and smith s2.65 dvar (red dots)}
    \label{fig:scatter_smith_0.78_vs_smith_dvar}
\end{figure}

The scatter plots are identical than those ones presented in the figure \ref{fig:scatter_madsen_vs_smith_def}, and any change on the skill metrics are evidenced. These results were suspicious due to the error metrics did not change at all and the largest $H_s$ values modelled with \textbf{smith s2.65 dvar} are identical to those ones obtained with \textbf{smith s.265 d0.1}. It was highly possible that SWAN was not reading the sediment diameter map and it was just applying the default conditions for the \textcite{Smith2011} parametrization. A further look in the source code exhibits that in the file \verb|swanmain.ftn| the following conditional is written in the lines 3722-3726:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Fortran]
IF (VARFR .AND. IBOT.EQ.5) THEN                                 41.51
     CALL MSGERR (1,
 &           'Ripples model active, space varying friction ignored')
     VARFR = .FALSE.
ENDIF
\end{lstlisting}

Where \verb|IBOT| is an indicator for the bottom friction which is specified in the file \verb|swancom.ftn|.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Fortran]
!     IBOT              Indicator for bottom friction
!                       IBOT = 0  no bottom friction dissipation

!                       IBOT = 5  bottom dissipation due to ripples
\end{lstlisting}

\verb|VARFR| is \verb|True| by default according to the file \verb|swanpre1.ftn| when the \verb|READinp| command is called to enter bottom friction information.

        LOGCOM(3) = .TRUE.                                                30.21
      ELSE IF (KEYWIS ('CUR')) THEN

        IGR2 = 3
        ICUR = 1
      ELSE IF (KEYWIS ('FR')) THEN
        IGR1   = 4
        VARFR  = .TRUE.
        MCMVAR = MCMVAR + 2                                               40.00
        JFRC2  = MCMVAR - 1                                               40.00
        JFRC3  = MCMVAR                                                   40.00
        ALOCMP = .TRUE.                                                   40.97
\end{lstlisting}
    
Finally, a last experiment was made to evaluate a most physical specific gravity for the bay. The default value is 2.65 based on the original parametrization, but based on the predominance of sublitoral mud, a most representative value for PPB would be 2.75. This value was tested in the experiment \textbf{smith s2.75 d0.01} and it was compared with \textbf{smith s2.65 d0.01}. The $H_s$ variability looks exactly identical for both simulations and the largest $H_s$ modelled values are the same. 

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[scale=0.7]{plots/hs_series/smith s2.65 d0.01_vs_smith s2.75 d0.01_vert.png}
    \caption{$H_{s}$ time series for each buoy under smith s2.65 d0.01 (blue line) and smith s2.75 d0.01 (green line) experiments.}
    \label{fig:hs_smith_s2.65_vs_smith_s2.75}
\end{figure}

The scatter plots end up showing the same distribution of the measured and modelled $H_s$ values for both experiments. This confirms that the changes on the specific gravity do not imply a strong effect in the estimation of $H_s$ values for PPB and the $H_s$ estimations can not be improved neither.

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[scale=0.7]{plots/scatter/smith s2.65 d0.01_vs_smith s2.75 d0.01_vert_sca.png}
    \caption{Comparison between modelled and observed $H_{s}$ values for each buoy for the experiments: smith s2.65 d0.01 (blue dots) and smith s2.7 d0.01 (green dots)}
    \label{fig:scatter_smith_s2.65_vs_smith_s2.75}
\end{figure}

As long as \textcite{Smith2011} parametrization in SWAN does not include spatial variability of diameter grain size and specific gravity, a most realistic scenario for the wave modelling in PPB can not be tested and the best configuration that can be used is \textbf{smith s2.65 d0.78}. 

\section{Simulation results including vegetation}

\subsection{A vegetation test case}

Initially, the vegetation test case for COAWST was simulated to verify the correct performance of the vegetation module and its interaction with SWAN and ROMS \parencite{Beudin2017}. A description and a scheme of the test case is presented below. 

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[scale=0.6]{plots/vegetation_test.png}
    \caption{Description of the vegetation test presented in the COAWST user manual \parencite{Warner2010}}
    \label{fig:veg_test_scheme}
\end{figure}

It is worth to mention that the southern edge is closed (zero gradient condition) and the western and eastern sides have a zero gradient boundary condition for the flow and an absorbing condition for the wave energy. \textcite{Beudin2017} demonstrated the effect of vegetation patch on the middle of the domain throughout the depth-averaged velocity at peak flood as it shown in figure \ref{fig:depth_avg_vel_1}

\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\begin{subfigure}{.5\textwidth}

\end{subfigure}
\caption{Comparison of the depth-averaged velocities, at peak flood according to the results evidenced by \textcite{Beudin2017} and those ones obtained with our verification of the test case. The patch of (stiff) vegetation is located in the red square. The hydrodynamic is forced at the northern boundary.}
\label{fig:grid_bathy_PPB}
\end{figure}

\subsection{An idealised case}

Before moving to the ROMS-SWAN coupled run, an initial simulation was made only with SWAN using the grid that was adapted from the ROMS grid to the wave model. The ROMS grid points are shown below.

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[scale=0.6]{plots/roms_grid.png}
    \caption{Grid points for ROMS and SWAN in the idealised vegetation case for PPB}
    \label{fig:roms_swan_grid_points}
\end{figure}

However, when SWAN is running an error with the grid angle occurs for most of the grid points as it can be seen in the \verb|PRINT| file.

\begin{lstlisting}
     READINP BOTTOM  1 './in/swan_bathy_veg_PPB.bot' 4 0 FREE
 ** Error            : Grid angle <0 or >180 degrees

 ** Error            : Grid angle <0 or >180 degrees
   1  7       144.6275       -38.3301   0  7       144.6271       -38.3298   0  6       144.6953       -38.3295
 ** Error            : Grid angle <0 or >180 degrees
   1  9       144.6924       -38.3294   1 10       144.6275       -38.3274   0 10       144.6271       -38.3271
\end{lstlisting}

Those points are finally removed from the computational grid, so the simulation is not succesfully executed.

\begin{lstlisting}
    ** Warning          : Point removed from computational grid
Point with index (     1,     2) was removed from computational grid, because it is part of a 1D configuration or 1D connection.
 ** Warning          : Point removed from computational grid
Point with index (     1,     5) was removed from computational grid, because it is part of a 1D configuration or 1D connection.
 ** Warning          : Point removed from computational grid
Point with index (     1,    74) was removed from computational grid, because it is part of a 1D configuration or 1D connection.
\end{lstlisting}

\section{Conclusions and recommendations}

This report summaries the work done in the Wave-Hydrodynamic Modelling research project funded by the Department of Energy, Environment and Climate Action (DEECA). Different configurations for two of the existing bottom friction parameterizations in SWAN were tested in PPB. The default setup for \textcite{Smith2011} evidenced a better performance than \textcite{Madsen_Poon_Graber_1988} for the one-month simulation period in the bay. Most of the stations show underestimation of $H_s$ and Sandringham station exhibit the largest systematic bias. The model represents the $H_s$ variability correctly at most of the time in each station, but it's not enough capable to represent the $H_s$ peaks. On the other hand, more realistic average value for the diameter grain size (0.78mm) and specific gravity (2.75) for \textcite{Smith2011} were evaluated with no improvement of the $H_s$ series regarding the default experiments.  Using regular grids for the specific gravity and diameter grain size were intended to offer the most physical configuration for PPB because the existence of different habitat and soil types, however it was found that \textcite{Smith2011} was implemented in the SWAN source code without allowing the use of maps for the input parameters.\\  

Regarding the evaluation of the effects of the vegetation in the wave dumping, a vegetation test case for COAWST was initially used to verify the correct performance of the vegetation module. A comparison of the depth-averaged velocities at peak flood in a rectangular grid with a vegetation path at the centre exhibited that the model compiled in Spartan solved properly the wave-current interaction. An idealised case (no wind forcing) for PPB were then prepared with the correct input files for SWAN and ROMS, but a problem with the definition of the curvilinear grid is presented.\\

Further work has to be done to incorporate the spatial variability of the input parameters in \textcite{Smith2011} in the source code. The revision of the curvilinear grid also has to be carried out in order to obtain the first results for the wave-current interaction in PPB.
